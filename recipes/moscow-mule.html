    <h1>Moscow Mule</h1>
    <img class="shape" src="https://www.acouplecooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Moscow-Mule-062.jpg">
<h2>A Moscow mule is a classic cocktail born in the 1940’s, made with vodka and ginger beer. It’s actually part of a family of cocktails called a buck: a cocktail made with liquor, ginger ale or ginger beer, and citrus juice. So, it can also be called a vodka buck!</h2>
    <p>Because a Moscow mule is all about the carbonation in the ginger beer, this drink is not mixed in a cocktail shaker. To preserve the carbonation, it’s simply mixed right in the mug and served over ice. You don’t even need a cocktail shaker! This makes it one of the easiest cocktail recipes you can find. Here’s what to do</p>
    <p>As you may know, Moscow mules are traditionally served in a copper cup or copped mug.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces Vodka</li>
        <li>4 ounces Ginger Beer</li>
        <li>1/2 oounce Lime Juice</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the vodka, lime juice, and ginger beer into a copper mug. </li>
        <li>Add ice and garnish with a lime slice. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
