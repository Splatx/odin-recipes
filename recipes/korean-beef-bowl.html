    <h1>Korean Beef Bowl</h1>
        <img class="shape" src="https://chefsavvy.com/wp-content/uploads/korean-beef-bowl.jpg">
    <h2>Now this recipe is a twist on the traditional Korean dish, bulgogi, but it’s a cheater version using ground beef instead of thin slices of sirloin, making this a budget-friendly dish.</h2>
        <p>Bulgogi is also marinated overnight to enhance its flavors and tenderness but with this ground beef version, you can have the same flavors in 15 minutes or less!</p>
        <p>So while we cut down on eating out during the week, I’m sure this beef bowl will be in constant rotation at our house!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes and ginger.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in soy sauce mixture and green onions until well combined, allowing to simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with green onion and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
