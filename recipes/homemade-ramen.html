    <h2>Fresh vegetables? Quick and easy homemade broth? A soft-boiled egg and a pile of our favorite curly-cue packaged ramen noodles that remind us of college? That’s this homemade ramen.</h2>
        <p>This recipe leans more in the direction of I-have-a-package-of-ramen-and-some-vegetables-can-we-make-lunch practical. Sort of healthy and fast and a little nostalgic (packaged ramen!) but also fresh-ly delicious with a ton of flavor.</p>
        <p>Simmering some garlic, ginger, and dried mushrooms with your chicken broth makes for a great quickie “stock”. A good while in the pot will get some nice flavors going that will soon be soaked up by those noodles. And by good while, I mean 19 minutes, because the whole thing takes 20. The soft egg on tops will get you all the Instagram likes, and the panko and extra chili oil or Sriracha will light your mouth up with joy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
            <li>4 cups broth (I used chicken, but vegetable would also work)</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 packages instant ramen (noodles only!)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped scallions or chives</li>
            <li>2 cup chopped kale</li>
            <li>1 cups shredded carrots</li>
            <li>Sriracha to taste</li>
            <li>crunchy golden panko crumbs for topping</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add the garlic and ginger; stir fry for 2 minutes or until soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the broth and the water. Bring to a simmer; add the mushrooms and simmer for 10 minutes or until the mushrooms have softened and the broth is flavorful.</li>
            <li>Add the instant noodles to the hot liquid and simmer for an additional 5 minutes or until the noodles have softened. Add the scallions and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, stir in the kale and carrots, and top with crunchy panko crumbs (see notes) and a soft-boiled egg (optional). Season with chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce and salt to taste.</li>
        </ol>
